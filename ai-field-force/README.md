# Kheti Compass

**An AI-Guided Visit Priority System for Syngenta Field Reps**

Team Farmlytics — IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science & Applications
Syngenta AgriTech Hackathon 2026 — Track: AI-Guided Field Force Intelligence

---

## What this is

Kheti Compass tells a Syngenta field rep, every morning: *who should I visit first today, and why?*

Each grower in the rep's territory gets a Visit Priority Score (0–100) computed from eight signals — weather, pest pressure, retailer inventory, visit cadence, complaints, crop stage, revenue potential, and competitor activity. The top three contributing signals are surfaced as `reasons[]` next to each score. Anomalies (overdue visits, open complaints, competitor sightings) appear alongside the ranking. The system learns from outcomes — every visit's rating adjusts the eight signal weights through a gradient update, and managers can browse the Learning Trail to see exactly what changed and why.

The brief asked for an "AI-guided field force intelligence" system. We read it as: *make the data Syngenta already collects show up in the rep's pocket every morning, ranked, with reasoning the rep can act on or argue with.*

## Live deployment

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | https://syngenta-nu.vercel.app |
| Backend | https://kheti-compass.onrender.com |
| API docs (Swagger) | https://kheti-compass.onrender.com/docs |

Free-tier hosting. First request after 15 minutes of idle takes ~30s to cold-start (Render free tier behavior). UptimeRobot keeps the backend warm during evaluation.

### Demo credentials

**Field rep accounts** (password: `syngenta123`):

- `rep@syngenta.com` — REP_0338, Bikaner, Rajasthan (primary demo rep, also linked to phone `9999999999`)
- `rep2@syngenta.com` — REP_0472, Sikar, Rajasthan
- `rep3@syngenta.com` — REP_0394, Mehsana, Gujarat
- `rep4@syngenta.com` — REP_0426, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh

**Manager account:**

- `manager@syngenta.com` / `manager123` — oversees all 10 reps (247 growers across Rajasthan, Gujarat, UP, Bihar)

## Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI 0.115 + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + SQLite (Python 3.11)
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite 5 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **LLM:** OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` for natural-language briefings (deterministic scoring is LLM-free)
- **Weather:** Open-Meteo (live, no API key required)
- **Auth:** JWT-based, supporting email+password (bcrypt), phone OTP, and Google OAuth — all converging on the same user identity
- **Hosting:** Render (backend) + Vercel (frontend), free tiers
- **Architecture:** Strict `routes → services → core` layering; the scoring engine has no awareness of HTTP or DB

## Quickstart — local development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (3.13 also works)
- Node.js 20.x LTS (Vite has known issues with 24.x — see DEPLOYMENT.md)
- An OpenAI API key (for the briefing endpoints; the rest of the system works without it)

### Backend

```bash
cd ai-field-force/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate           # Linux/macOS
# OR  venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # Windows PowerShell

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create your .env from the example
cp .env.example .env               # Linux/macOS
# OR  Copy-Item .env.example .env  # Windows PowerShell

# Fill in OPENAI_API_KEY and JWT_SECRET in .env

# Seed the demo data (10 reps, 247 growers, fetches real weather from Open-Meteo)
python -m db.seed_data

# Run the dev server
uvicorn main:app --reload
# Backend now at http://localhost:8000
# Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd ai-field-force/frontend
npm install

# Create your .env.local from the example
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # Linux/macOS
# OR  Copy-Item .env.local.example .env.local  # Windows PowerShell

# Edit .env.local — set VITE_API_BASE_URL to http://localhost:8000 for local backend,
# or to https://kheti-compass.onrender.com to use the live backend.

npm run dev
# Frontend now at http://localhost:5173
```

Log in at `http://localhost:5173` with any of the demo credentials above.
